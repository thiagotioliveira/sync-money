üîí Legend:

   * ‚úÖ = Requires valid JWT in Authorization: Bearer <token>
   * ‚ùå = Public endpoint (no authentication required)

üîê Authentication:

All protected endpoints require a valid JWT token to be included in the request header:

```
   Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

Example:

```
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

You receive this token when you log in via the /api/auth/login endpoint.
Use this token to authenticate requests to all endpoints marked as protected in the table above.
